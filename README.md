# RotMCDmgCalc
This a dps calculator for your weapons on a minecraft server called RotMC. Ip: play.rotmc.xyz.
With this, you input the damage of your weapon, attack cooldown, spell damage, spell cooldown, crit chance AS A DECIMAL, attack percent AS A DECIMAL, and the enemy health. Upon pressing the button, it will calculate the stats and give you your main attack dps, spell dps, the combination of the 2, and how long it would take to kill the enemy.
You may either download the exe, or copy the C# code if you do not trust the exe file. The exe is easier because it does not require you to download raylib_cslo off of nuget and a compiler for C#.
